%Title: IBB Script
%Author: McCafferty
%script for the program to decide if an intentional walk is a good idea
%given a certain game situation and and lineup of batters
%based on the data given in Chapter 10 of The Book by Tom Tango, Mitchel
%Lightman, and Andrew Dolphin

while (bases ~= 23 && bases ~= 2 && bases ~= 3 && bases ~= 13)
    bases = input('Not a valid base state for an IBB, try again: ');
